*Click to watch a preview*


**UpNext** is a task management app that lets you **visualize time-sensitive tasks chronologically**. It emerged out of a need for the developer to keep track of all of his homework and personal projects based on due date, a feat that no other task management app could perform well. 

## Features
- Add any number of tasks and see how much time is left for each task at a glance
- Edit and complete tasks as needed
- Tasks without due dates work too!
- Dynamically generated chronological chart allows the app to work at nearly any size
- Autosave and autoload

UpNext was written in Java for an Introduction to Software Construction course in the spring of 2021.
