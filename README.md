**UpNext** is a task management app that lets you **visualize time-sensitive tasks chronologically**. It emerged out of a need for the developer to keep track of all of his homework and personal projects based on due date, a feat that no other task management app could perform well. UpNext can keep track of many tasks at once and display a graph that makes it easy to understand the most important task to focus on.
