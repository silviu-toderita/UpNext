# TimeOut

TimeOut is a task management app that lets you visualize time-sensitive tasks chronologically. It emerged out of a need for the developer to keep track of all of his homework and personal projects based on due date, a feat that no other task management app could perform well. TimeOut can keep track of many tasks at once and display a graph that makes it easy to understand the most important task to focus on. In addition to time, a second dimension of importance or *weight* can also be optionally added to a task to differentiate it from a less important task with the same due date. 

TimeOut will be used by anyone who needs a quick and easy way to manage and visualize their time-sensitive tasks. This includes students, employees, managers, entrepreneurs, and busy instructors. It has wide appeal and will implement unique features and a user-friendly interface to help it stand out from a sea of generic task-management apps. 

This project is interesting to me because chronological task-management has always been a pain. I personally feel stressed when I see a list of tasks I have to do and no immediate way of being able to tell how *busy* I actually am. Visualizing tasks chronologically would help me  feel more in-control of my work and life. For that reason, I'm excited to develop something that will be useful to me and I intend to actively use after development is complete.

the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.
